# NLP-Question-Answering-in-documents

TLDR: This is a research for a task to find specific labels in various legal documents. To do this this, I used Transformers Question Answering model: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/question_answering

The notebook includes EDA, data preproccessing, model selection and reasults

I achieved 81% Accuracy (i.e exact match on validation dataset)
